# Millennial Migration

A study on Millennial migration patterns in the United States. 

We set out to find answers to the question of whether or not Millenials are moving out of major American cities. Seeing that Millennials are, in fact, leaving some of the biggest cities in the country, we looked for what motivates the decision to leave cultural hubs and hot job markets. Next, we asked where people are moving to and why they seem to choose those locales. We were able to aggregate data from the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the F.B.I. to find that Millennials aren't leaving cities, they're just leaving expensive ones.
